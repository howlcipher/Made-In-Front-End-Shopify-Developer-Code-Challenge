<h1>Made In Front End / Shopify Developer Code Challenge</h1>

<h2>Code Challenge:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Your solutions should be written in Javascript</li>
  <li>These problems should take you 10-15 minutes, or less.</li>
  <li>Feel free to refactor, beyond just passing the basic requirements.</li>
  <li>Also feel free to leave comments (in your code) regarding your thought process, observations, or gray areas about requirements.</li>
  <li>We're not necessarily looking for the most concise or elegant solutions. This is just a chance to show that you can solve basic problems and write reasonably well-organized readable code.</li>
  <li>Your solution should run correctly if pasted into a console or into node.</li>
  <li><strong>Do not</strong> paste your code directly into the form. Please provide a private gist link or some other online code-share link in the form.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Exercise #1: Palindrome Checker</strong>

Write a function that accepts a single string argument, and returns a boolean indicating whether the string is a palindrome.

It should satisfy these test cases:
"oscar" -> false<br>
"aaaa" -> true<br>
"Racecar" -> true<br>
"Madam, I'm Adam" -> true<br>


<strong>Exercise #2: Fizzbuzz</strong>

Counting from 0 to 100, print out each number to the console, making the following substitutions …

… If the number is a multiple of 3, print `fizz` in place of the number<br>
… If the number is a multiple of 5, print `buzz` in place of the number<br>
… If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print `fizzbuzz` in place of the number<br>
… Otherwise, just print the number itself.

Each entry should be printed to a new line.


<strong>Exercise #3: Array / Object Manipulation</strong>

Assume a large array of objects representing cookware products, with each object
This is a three-part challenge – write a separate function or expression that does each of the following. These should all be in the same gist or snippet, and labeled / named appropriately:

Return an array of only the products that are priced greater than or equal to 75.
Return an array of only the products that are heavier than 1.8.
Transform the array into an object, where the keys are IDs and the values are the remaining object properties
